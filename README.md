# Odin Kittens

Odin Kittens is an exercise in basic API building.  Users can perform each of the seven RESTful actions on a Kitten object.  HTML requests can be handled through the main site interface.  Conversely, a list of Kittens, as well as information about an indivudual Kitten, can be obtained in JSON format through an API request.
